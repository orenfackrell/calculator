# calculator

The task is to create a functioning calculator with the four math operators addition, subraction, multiplication and division. I have decided that the display should show the result to the calculation but also update with the inputs in the calculator so that the user has more clarity on what they are performing on the calculator. I have also taken on the additional task of implimenting a decimal point button and a backspace button for the user. 
This project will be utilizing: css styling; JS maths functions; JS to update the display; JS to have responding buttons.
